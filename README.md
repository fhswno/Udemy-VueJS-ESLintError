# cmp-communication-01-starting-setupUdemy-VueJS-ESLintError

Code files which lead to the ESLint Error reported to Udemy Instructor of the Vue.js Course for Lecture 92 (Same issue in Lecture 79)

You will find the folder I used to run the install npm & npm run serve commands, as required in the course.

Let me know if you need anything else to provide some guidance on this error,

Best,

David
